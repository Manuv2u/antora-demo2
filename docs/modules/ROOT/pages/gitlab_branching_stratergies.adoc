*_GIT BRANCHING STRATERGIES_* +
====
*_Build branching strategy from these three concepts:_*
====
. Use feature branches for all new features and bug fixes. +
* Develop your features and fix bugs in feature branches based off your main branch.
* Feature branches isolate work in progress from the completed work in the main branch.
* Git branches are inexpensive to create and maintain.
* Even small fixes and changes should have their own feature branch. +

. Merge feature branches into the main branch using pull requests. +
* The review that takes place in a pull request is critical for improving code quality.
* Only merge branches through pull requests that pass your review process.
* Avoid merging branches to the main branch without a pull request.

. Keep a high quality, up-to-date main branch. +
* The code in your main branch should pass tests, build cleanly, and always be current.
* Requires a pull request to merge code. This approach prevents direct pushes to the main branch and ensures discussion of proposed changes.
* Automatically adds reviewers when a pull request is created. The added team members review the code and comment on the changes in the pull request.
* Requires a successful build to complete a pull request. Code merged into the main branch should build cleanly.
